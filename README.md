Load Forecasting Competition (Kaggle)

This repository holds my work on producing a Time Series Regression model, combined with harmonics and piecewise linear function to generate zone-localised short-term forecast for an entire power grid. The forecasting performance reduces error (average RMSE) by roughly 30%, at par with high accuracy models found globally in the Gefcom 2012 Kaggle competition. When forecasting horizon is considered together with missing values, the improvement over benchmark (in terms of avg RMSE) is 13%.
