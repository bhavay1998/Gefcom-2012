Load Forecasting Competition (Kaggle)

This repository holds my work on producing a Time Series Regression model, combined with harmonics and piecewise linear function to generate zone-localised short-term forecast for an entire power grid. The forecasting performance reduces error (average RMSE) by roughly 30%, at par with high accuracy models found globally in the Gefcom 2012 Kaggle competition.
