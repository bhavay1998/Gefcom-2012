Load Forecasting Competition (Kaggle)

This repository holds my works on producing a Time Series Regression model, combined with harmonics and piecewise linear function to generate zone-localised short-term forecast for an entire power grid.
The forecasting performance reduces error by roughly 30%, at par with the most competitive models globally in the Gefcom 2012 Kaggle competition.
